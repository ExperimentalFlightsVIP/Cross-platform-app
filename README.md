# Cross-platform-app
Github repo for the cross platform version of the experimental flights Client App. 

**Note for beginners (as of Spring_2022):**

Use Debug -> 'expo start' inside package.json to run the app. 

When developer tools link open (localhost:X, Metro Bundler), run in web browser instead of IOS or Android emulator options. 
^ Disregard this with later updates post-Spring_2022.
